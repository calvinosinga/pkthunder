**P** (**k**): **T**racers, **H**alos, **UNDER**standing

Used for building intuition and understanding of halo models, and how the power spectrum is affected by the various knobs you can turn.

Halo models (in general) require four ingredients in order to generate power spectra, the halo bias, halo mass function, tracer mass to halo mass function, and the density profile. I allow for the ingredients to be defined in two ways. One requires analytical expressions for each of the terms, while the other takes data from n-body simulations and creates them numerically.
